# Conway's game of life got bugged :)

## Experiment
Conway&rsquo;s game of life, who hasn't heard of it :) Well for me it has been a toy and a joy for many years.
Check Wikipedia for an explanation of Conway&rsquo;s life. As life on it's own has a tendency to die out, I figured to introduce another life form that interacts with the cellular automata, to keep things going.
* These 'bugs' that I introduced eat the life cells
* The more they eat, the more they grow - to a certain extent
* As they move, they burn energy and eventually shrink again
* They leave droppings behind in the form of small life gliders
* When they have grown enough, they can find a mate to reproduce with
* Their offspring inherits properties like how much and often they turn
* They die when they don't get enough food and then scatter - in life cells :)

## Life controls
Life can be controlled with the START, STOP, STEP and STEP BACK buttons, which are quite self-explanatory.
The following shortcut keys can be used as well:
* down - stop
* up - start
* right - step
* return - restart life
* insert - toggle ‘trails’
* delete - clear life
* click - draw life
